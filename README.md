# hbtelegram
Class to facilitate the development of telegram bot from Harbour.

Compile the library simply by indicating: 
hbmk2 hbtelegram.hbp

Register your bot in telegram via BotFather, then edit test/bot_token.ch and enter the token and name of your bot.

Compile (hbmk2 bot)

In telegram, find your bot, open a chat with the bot and select "start". Run your newly compiled executable, check the movements produced locally and in the bot. ;)
